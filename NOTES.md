# Decision Notes

## 2026-09-15 — Target application

### Decision

Use **LedgerSMB** as the primary target application. Keep **Dolibarr** as the
fallback.

### Rationale

- Dolibarr may prove to be the stronger target on purely technical or practical
  grounds.
- LedgerSMB is more closely aligned with the assignment's banking and financial
  back-office setting.
- That domain alignment is important enough to evaluate LedgerSMB first.

### Implications

- Pin and evaluate a specific LedgerSMB release before designing around its UI.
- Choose a workflow that exercises search, detail inspection, typed outputs,
  runtime outcomes, and a conservative boundary around state-changing actions.
- Fall back to Dolibarr if LedgerSMB cannot provide a repeatable local setup or a
  sufficiently useful workflow without disproportionate setup work.

### Still open

- LedgerSMB version and local deployment method.
- Representative workflow and seeded fixture data.
- Concrete threshold for invoking the Dolibarr fallback.
